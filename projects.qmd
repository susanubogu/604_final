## Airbnb Report (Linear & Decision Tree Regression)
This was a project I worked on for my Machine Learning in Business class last semester. We used a dataset from Kaggle that had data for Airbnbs. We performed a linear regression and a descision tree regression to determine which variables had the biggest impact on Airbnb prices. Taking those results we were then able to provide a business recommendation to someone who was considering listing on the platform.
