## Airbnb Report (Linear & Decision Tree Regression)
This was a project I worked on for my Machine Learning in Business class last semester. We used a dataset from Kaggle that had data for Airbnbs. We performed a linear regression and a descision tree regression to determine which variables had the biggest impact on Airbnb prices. Taking those results we were then able to provide a business recommendation to someone who was considering listing on the platform.

## IMDB Movie Analysis (Dashboard Presentation)
This is a small personal project that I worked on to build a dashboard that made it easy to pull data about IMDB movies throughout the decades. The first iteration of it takes a look, specifically, at the numbers by decade. 

For example, the visualization below we are able to see that between 1990 and 200 there was a total of 539,000 movies that were either released or ongoing amounting to a total of around 38 million minutes of run time. We are also able to see that the most popular genre were pieces that were classified as both a drama and a romantic piece of work. And lastly, there were far more pieces that were not classed as adult, a trend we see throughout the decades.
