:::{#me}

My name is Susan Ubogu and I am an accelerated master's student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working towards to a MSc in Data Analytics & Computational Social Sciences. I recently received a BBA in Operations & Information Management and a BSc in Computer Science. 

I have always be interested in working at the intersection of technology and business and I have a lot of professional experiences that speak to that. I've held roles at RBC Capital Markets, EY, and more recently an M&A outfit. I'm really interested in seeing how my degree in data analysis will help me in these roles. 

## Goals
I have a couple of big goals for my life but the biggest would be running my own startup someday. I hope to one day be able to use AI to try and reveolutionze either the education space or the financial industry.

## Education
I have a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science as well as a Bachelors of Business Administration in Operations & Information Management. 

## Experience
I've had internships at EY, RBC Capital Markets, and other financial outfits.
